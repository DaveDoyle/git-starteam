This project aim to bring an interface layer between Git and Starteam.

Current Goal:
Bring the capacity of converting Starteam project to Git with the help
of the fast-import capacity. I'll be doing this with the help of a 
fake layer that emulate the behavior of the StarteamSDK. This layer 
could be used as a test platform.

Futur Goal:
Give the capacity of making git a Starteam compatible client with the
added value of using Git. This could also be used for Mercurial and 
Bazaar with the help of the fast-export capacity.

License:
Git-Starteam is convered under the General Public License Version 3.
Fake-Starteam is convered under a personnal license and is included 
only for testing purpose. The project shall not be used for any other
purpose than easly testing your interaction with a fake starteam server.
